# Vizzlo Test Drive: Frontend Engineer

Hi there, future Vizzlonaut,

and welcome to your Test Drive! We'll give you a bunch of tasks to solve today
and observe how you tackle them.

## Overview

Please read through the following task descriptions before starting them to make
sure you can divide your time properly. We ask you to do _all_ of the tasks.

The work you'll be doing today will be based on the contents of this GitHub Gist
that we ask you to fork and and send a link to the modified version back by
mail.

Alas, you will not get more information about the content of the gist, than what
is written here. Feel free to use the tools you need, we only expect the results
you deliver to be clear and easily readable as well as executable. Also, try to
commit your results in proper stages.

That's all for now. Have a lot of fun!

## Task 1

The following image depicts a Bar Chart (created using Vizzlo) with some example
data. Please implement a basic copy of this chart using the technology you find
in the Gist.

## Task 2

This is the corresponding Pie Chart (using the same dataset). Please implement
this, too.

## Task 3

Please add a few controls to your application, that allow the user to:

* Toggle between the chart types (task 1 and 2),
* Modify the number of records (bars/slices) displayed, and
* Randomize the per-record data.

## Task 4

Please add unit tests to your application.

## Task 5

Please describe in a few paragraphs how you would implement a "Download Image"
option. What technology would you use to implement this an why? What would the
flow of data look like? What are the pros and cons of using this technology when
comparing with other options?

## Frequently Asked Questions

##### Do I really have to do all tasks?

Yes. If you do not have enough time, it is better to do all tasks on a
no-so-detailed level, compared to not touching some of the tasks at all.

##### Can I add new packages to the setup?

Yes, absolutely.

##### I am used to working with a different setup. Can I use mine to do the test?

Yes, but please add a brief explanation of why you chose to do so.
